# -A-B-Testing-Approach-for-Comparing-Performance-of-ML-Models
The objective of this project is to compare the performance of BERT and DistilBERT models for building an efficient Question and Answering system. Using A/B testing approach, we explore the effectiveness and efficiency of both models and determine which one is better suited for Q&amp;A tasks.

# Question and Answering Model Performance Comparison

## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our project on comparing the performance of BERT and DistilBERT models for building an efficient Question and Answering (Q&A) system. This project utilizes an A/B testing approach to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of both models, ultimately determining which one is better suited for Q&A tasks.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to evaluate the performance of BERT and DistilBERT models in the context of a Question and Answering system. We aim to answer the following key questions:

1. **Effectiveness**: Which model, BERT or DistilBERT, provides more accurate answers to given questions?

2. **Efficiency**: Which model, BERT or DistilBERT, performs Q&A tasks more quickly and with lower computational resources?

By comparing these aspects, we hope to provide insights into the choice of model for developers and researchers working on Q&A systems.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

1. **Data**: This directory contains the datasets used for testing and evaluation of the models.

2. **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

3. **Models**: Pretrained BERT and DistilBERT models for Q&A tasks.

4. **Scripts**: Utility scripts for data processing and model evaluation.

5. **Results**: Logs, metrics, and visualizations generated during the project.
